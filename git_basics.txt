git branch - This command will display the branches in your local(your machine)

Two terminologies

1. Local - Your local machine
2. Remote - Your remote repository you are going to push 

What is repository ?
    Imagine repository as a database containing all your code versioned as 1,2,3,4,5 (prefix version in front of numbers for your 
reference)

    You can clone or create such repository in your local machine

    1. You can achieve this by doing git clone git@github.com:kishorekumar-hub/git_basics.git -- this is like the url link to the
    remote repository.
    2. Difference between fork and clone
        1. Fork - Let's assume that if your organization/project where multiple people will work on the repository. So each one needs
        a remote repository to be created. So you can Fork from the main repository. Note: You cannot clone your own repository
        2. Clone - This comes handy to you when you want the remote repository to your local machine.

            git clone git@github.com:kishorekumar-hub/git_basics.git
